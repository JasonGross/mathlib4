# Effective epimorphisms and finite effective epimorphic families in `CompHaus`

This file proves that `CompHaus` is `Preregular`. Together with the fact that it is
`FinitaryPreExtensive`, this implies that `CompHaus` is `Precoherent`.

To do this, we need to characterise effective epimorphisms in `CompHaus`. As a consequence, we also
get a characterisation of finite effective epimorphic families.

## Main results

* `CompHaus.effectiveEpi_tfae`: For a morphism in `CompHaus`, the conditions surjective, epimorphic,
  and effective epimorphic are all equivalent.

* `CompHaus.effectiveEpiFamily_tfae`: For a finite family of morphisms in `CompHaus` with fixed
  target in `CompHaus`, the conditions jointly surjective, jointly epimorphic and effective
  epimorphic are all equivalent.

As a consequence, we obtain instances that `CompHaus` is precoherent and preregular.

## Projects

- Define regular categories, and show that `CompHaus` is regular.
- Define coherent categories, and show that `CompHaus` is actually coherent.

Previously, this had accidentally been made a global instance,
